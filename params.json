This is the standalone version. The full documentation of MLZ is located [here](http://lcdm.astro.illinois.edu/static/code/mlz/MLZ-1.0/doc/html/index.html)\r\n\r\nFor more information and a implementation of this technique, check this [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6442) \r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n* scipy\r\n* matplotlib\r\n* numpy\r\n* pyfits (to store output file)\r\n* mpi4py (optional for parallel running)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo run:\r\n\r\n    python example_sparse.py\r\n\r\nTo check the results:\r\n\r\n    python read_sparse.py\r\n\r\n\r\nThe format of the original PDF file is given in a numpy array but can eb easily change and corresponds to a 2D array where each row is the PDF and the very last row are the redshift positions.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
